# Default match rule is growth percentage > deviation
# Example:
#  growth percentage = 0.3, deviation = 0.2 is matched rule

# If negative_growth value, match rule is growth percentage < deviation

# This option will cause ElastAlert to subtract a time delta from every query, causing the rule to run with a delay.
# This is useful if the data is Elasticsearch doesnâ€™t get indexed immediately.
